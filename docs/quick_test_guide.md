# QUICK TEST GUIDE - Version 3.0

## ⚡ PRIORITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ **LOGGER FIXED**
**Problem:** Logs weren't being written (aviator.log was empty)  
**Cause:** `init_logging()` didn't return logger  
**Fixed:** Now returns logger properly

### 2. ✅ **DATABASE PERFORMANCE FIXED** 
**Problem:** Only 35K inserts in 2 hours (expected 144K)  
**Cause:** Single inserts (batch_size=1)  
**Fixed:** Batch inserts (batch_size=50)

### 3. ✅ **PREDICTION IMPROVED**
**Problem:** Poor accuracy with only RGB  
**Cause:** Insufficient features  
**Fixed:** 20+ features (historical, statistical, trends)

## 🧪 TEST PLAN

### Phase 1: Verify Logging (5 minutes)

1. **Check logger.py has return statement:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "return root_logger" logger.py
   ```
   Should see line number with `return root_logger`

2. **Start system briefly:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   # Stop after 30 seconds (Ctrl+C)
   ```

3. **Verify logs exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -lah logs/
   ```
   Expected files:
   - `main.log` (not empty!)
   - `balkanbet_<PID>.log` (if BalkanBet running)
   - `mozzart_<PID>.log` (if Mozzart running)
   - etc.

4. **Check log content:**
   ```bash
   tail -20 logs/main.log
   ```
   Should see:
   ```
   2025-10-04 HH:MM:SS | INFO     | System               | ====================================
   2025-10-04 HH:MM:SS | INFO     | System               | Logging initialized - ...
   2025-10-04 HH:MM:SS | INFO     | System               | Process: MainProcess (PID: XXXX)
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Log files exist and contain actual log entries

---

### Phase 2: Verify Database Batching (15 minutes)

1. **Check config:**
   ```bash
   grep "batch_size" config.py
   ```
   Should see: `batch_size = 50`

2. **Start data collection:**
   ```bash
   python data_collector.py
   # Let it run for 10 minutes
   ```

3. **Monitor logs in real-time:**
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/main.log | grep "Batch processed"
   ```
   Should see:
   ```
   ✅ Batch processed: 50/50 items in 8.2ms
   ✅ Batch processed: 48/50 items in 7.9ms
   ```

4. **Check statistics (after 10 min):**
   Look for in logs:
   ```
   📊 Stats: XXXX processed, YY.Y items/sec, avg batch: ZZ.Z items, queue: Q
   ```

5. **Calculate throughput:**
   - For 4 bookmakers @ 0.2s: expect ~20 items/sec
   - After 10 minutes: expect ~12,000 items processed
   - After 1 hour: expect ~72,000 items processed

6. **Query database:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 aviator.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rounds;"
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ ~12,000 records after 10 minutes (vs 2,900 in old system)

---

### Phase 3: Verify No Data Loss (30 minutes)

1. **Start full collection for 30 minutes:**
   ```bash
   python data_collector.py
   # Let run for exactly 30 minutes
   ```

2. **Monitor queue size:**
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/main.log | grep "queue:"
   ```
   Queue size should stay < 1000 (warning at 5000)

3. **Check for warnings:**
   ```bash
   grep "Queue size critical" logs/*.log
   ```
   Should be EMPTY (no warnings)

4. **After 30 minutes, check final stats:**
   Stop program (Ctrl+C) and look for:
   ```
   ==========================================================
   DATABASE WORKER - FINAL STATISTICS
   ==========================================================
   Total processed:     36,000   (expected for 30min @ 20/sec)
   Total batches:       ~750
   Total errors:        0
   Queue warnings:      0
   ```

5. **Verify database:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 aviator.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rounds;"
   # Should be ~36,000
   
   sqlite3 aviator.db "SELECT bookmaker, COUNT(*) FROM rounds GROUP BY bookmaker;"
   # Should show roughly equal distribution
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ ~36,000 records with no queue warnings

---

### Phase 4: Test Prediction System (10 minutes)

1. **Run prediction training:**
   ```bash
   python prediction_analyzer.py
   ```

2. **Check output:**
   Should see:
   ```
   Loading data from aviator.db...
   Loaded XXXX rounds
   Engineering features...
   Created 25+ features
   Training Random Forest...
   Training Gradient Boosting...
   
   RANDOM FOREST PERFORMANCE
   ==========================
                 precision  recall  f1-score
   ...
   
   ✅ Models saved to prediction_models.pkl
   ```

3. **Verify model file:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh prediction_models.pkl
   # Should exist and be several MB
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Model trained with >70% accuracy

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Logs still empty

**Check:**
```python
# logger.py line ~75
return root_logger  # THIS LINE MUST EXIST
```

**Fix:** Make sure you replaced `logger.py` with new version

---

### Issue: Low throughput (still ~10 items/sec)

**Check:**
```bash
grep "batch_size" main/bookmaker_orchestrator.py
```

**Should see:**
```python
batch_size = min(50, max(10, self.num_bookmakers * 10))
```

**Fix:** Make sure you replaced `bookmaker_orchestrator.py`

---

### Issue: Queue warnings appearing

**Possible causes:**
1. Database is slow (disk I/O issue)
2. Too many bookmakers for your CPU
3. Batch size too small

**Fix:**
```python
# config.py
batch_size = 100  # Increase to 100
batch_timeout = 0.5  # Decrease to 0.5s
```

---

### Issue: Prediction training fails

**Check:**
```bash
sqlite3 aviator.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rounds;"
```

**Need at least 10,000 records** for training

**Fix:** Let system collect more data first

## 🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION

Once all tests pass:

1. **Turn off debug mode:**
   ```python
   # config.py
   debug = False
   ```

2. **Run continuous collection:**
   ```bash
   nohup python data_collector.py > output.log 2>&1 &
   ```

3. **Monitor periodically:**
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/main.log | grep "Stats:"
   ```

4. **Train prediction model weekly:**
   ```bash
   python prediction_analyzer.py
   ```

## 📞 NEED HELP?

If tests fail:
1. Check all files were replaced
2. Check Python version (3.8+)
3. Check Tesseract OCR installed
4. Check disk space available
5. Share log files for debugging
